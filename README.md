## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop predictive models for GDP per capita based on socio-economic indicators using Ridge and Lasso regression. These techniques are chosen for their ability to handle multicollinearity and perform variable selection, respectively.

## Data

- The dataset includes socio-economic indicators such as population, literacy rate, birth rate, and more.
- Features are preprocessed and standardized for modeling.
- Categorical variables like country and region are encoded using appropriate techniques.

## Methodology

- **Ridge Regression**: Implements regularization to mitigate multicollinearity.
- **Lasso Regression**: Performs feature selection by shrinking coefficients to zero.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics include R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and diagnostics for homoscedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan test.

## Results

- Models are evaluated on a testing dataset for performance and assumptions.
- Homoscedasticity is assessed, and potential corrections are discussed.
